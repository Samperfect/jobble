# Joble - Simple Job Board App With 2-Factor Authentication

Joble is a simple job posting app built using Express on top of the NodeJS environment. Joble simply allows registration and posting of jobs (that's all it does!).

<!-- The main reason for this app is to run an application on the most secure port (port 443) while having 2FA (two-factor athentication) in place.

It's a part of a master's student project on authentication and web security the other part is a [web vulnerability scanner](https://pen-tester.herokuapp.com/). -->
